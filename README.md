# mujoco-py [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://openai.github.io/mujoco-py/build/html/index.html) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openai/mujoco-py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openai/mujoco-py)

[MuJoCo](http://mujoco.org/) is a physics engine for detailed, efficient rigid body simulations with contacts.
`mujoco-py` allows using MuJoCo from Python 3.

This library has been updated to be compatible with MuJoCo version 2.0 released on 10/1/2018.


## Synopsis

### Requirements

The following platforms are currently supported:

- Linux with Python 3.6. See [the `Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) for the canonical list of system dependencies.
- OS X with Python 3.6.

The following platforms are DEPRECATED and unsupported:

- Windows support has been DEPRECATED and removed in [2.0.2.0]. One known good past version is [1.50.1.68](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/blob/9ea9bb000d6b8551b99f9aa440862e0c7f7b4191/README.md#requirements).
- Python 2 has been DEPRECATED and removed in [1.50.1.0](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/releases/tag/1.50.1.0). Python 2 users can stay on the [`0.5` branch](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/tree/0.5). The latest release there is [`0.5.7`](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/releases/tag/0.5.7) which can be installed with `pip install mujoco-py==0.5.7`.

### Install MuJoCo

1. Obtain a 30-day free trial on the [MuJoCo website](https://www.roboti.us/license.html)
   or free license if you are a student.
   The license key will arrive in an email with your username and password.
2. Download the MuJoCo version 2.0 binaries for
   [Linux](https://www.roboti.us/download/mujoco200_linux.zip) or
   [OSX](https://www.roboti.us/download/mujoco200_macos.zip).
3. Unzip the downloaded `mujoco200` directory into `~/.mujoco/mujoco200`,
   and place your license key (the `mjkey.txt` file from your email)
   at `~/.mujoco/mjkey.txt`.

If you want to specify a nonstandard location for the key and package,
use the env variables `MUJOCO_PY_MJKEY_PATH` and `MUJOCO_PY_MUJOCO_PATH`.

### Install and use `mujoco-py`
To include `mujoco-py` in your own package, add it to your requirements like so:
```
mujoco-py<2.1,>=2.0
```
To play with `mujoco-py` interactively, follow these steps:
```
$ pip3 install -U 'mujoco-py<2.1,>=2.0'
$ python3
import mujoco_py
import os
mj_path, _ = mujoco_py.utils.discover_mujoco()
xml_path = os.path.join(mj_path, 'model', 'humanoid.xml')
model = mujoco_py.load_model_from_path(xml_path)
sim = mujoco_py.MjSim(model)

print(sim.data.qpos)
# [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

sim.step()
print(sim.data.qpos)
# [-2.09531783e-19  2.72130735e-05  6.14480786e-22 -3.45474715e-06
#   7.42993721e-06 -1.40711141e-04 -3.04253586e-04 -2.07559344e-04
#   8.50646247e-05 -3.45474715e-06  7.42993721e-06 -1.40711141e-04
#  -3.04253586e-04 -2.07559344e-04 -8.50646247e-05  1.11317030e-04
#  -7.03465386e-05 -2.22862221e-05 -1.11317030e-04  7.03465386e-05
#  -2.22862221e-05]
```

See the [full documentation](https://openai.github.io/mujoco-py/build/html/index.html) for advanced usage.

### Missing GLFW

A common error when installing is:

    raise ImportError("Failed to load GLFW3 shared library.")

Which happens when the `glfw` python package fails to find a GLFW dynamic library.

MuJoCo ships with its own copy of this library, which can be used during installation.

Add the path to the mujoco bin directory to your dynamic loader:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin pip install mujoco-py

This is particularly useful on Ubuntu 14.04, which does not have a GLFW package.

## Usage Examples

A number of examples demonstrating some advanced features of `mujoco-py` can be found in [`examples/`](/./examples/). These include:
- [`body_interaction.py`](./examples/body_interaction.py): shows interactions between colliding bodies
- [`disco_fetch.py`](./examples/disco_fetch.py): shows how `TextureModder` can be used to randomize object textures
- [`internal_functions.py`](./examples/internal_functions.py): shows how to call raw mujoco functions like `mjv_room2model`
- [`markers_demo.py`](./examples/markers_demo.py): shows how to add visualization-only geoms to the viewer
- [`serialize_model.py`](./examples/serialize_model.py): shows how to save and restore a model
- [`setting_state.py`](./examples/setting_state.py):  shows how to reset the simulation to a given state
- [`tosser.py`](./examples/tosser.py): shows a simple actuated object sorting robot application

See the [full documentation](https://openai.github.io/mujoco-py/build/html/index.html) for advanced usage.

## Development

To run the provided unit and integrations tests:

```
make test
```

To test GPU-backed rendering, run:

```
make test_gpu
```

This is somewhat dependent on internal OpenAI infrastructure at the moment, but it should run if you change the `Makefile` parameters for your own setup.

## Changelog

- 03/08/2018: We removed MjSimPool, because most of benefit one can get with multiple processes having single simulation.
